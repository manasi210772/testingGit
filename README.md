_Some commands_  
_* pls Ignore_

_for pushing a project made already_

`git clone <-repo link->`

`git status`

`git add <-file name->` //adding a new file

`git commit -m "the commit"` //changing "the commit" to the changes you made

`git push origin main` //saving everything in github


OR

_for enabling git at the start of thr project(to keep track of it easily)_

`git init`

`git add <-file name->`

`git commit -m "the commit"`

`git remote add origin <-repo link->`

`git remote -v //to verify remote`

`git branch`

`git push -u origin main //for future`
